# ScrumApp
The goal of this project is to as I would put it to Scrum my life. I grew tired of being ineffective. After some searching my gaze stopped on scrum. But it's hard to create a list for every sprint and know what's left to do. Then I thought, I want to learn c++, why not get two birds pregnant and kill them with one rock. 

So to conclude, I will with this project
* Evolve my c++ skills!
* Make it easier to scrum my life to perfection!
